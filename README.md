# custom-html-element-shadow-dom
Custom Html element with svg in shadow and color attribute which changes color of one svg path.

It was created just for me to hang of creating custom element with attributes.

I used a node http server to host my files.
I got the server.js from [adrianmejia.com](http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2016/08/24/Building-a-Node-js-static-file-server-files-over-HTTP-using-ES6/)
Got the android svg from [dev.w3](https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/android.svg)
